 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

# From walkthrough: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem#a-ruby-on-rails
# Make sure the file has .scss extension (or .sass for Sass syntax). If you have just generated a new Rails app, it may come with a .css file instead. If this file exists, it will be served instead of Sass, so rename it:
# $ mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
# Then, remove all the *= require and *= require_tree statements from the Sass file. Instead, use @import to import Sass files.
# Do not use *= require in Sass or your other stylesheets will not be able to access the Bootstrap mixins and variables.
*/

// Custom bootstrap variables must be set or imported *before* bootstrap.
@import "bootstrap";
